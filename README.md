# ENSM_project

In this cohort study, we explore the potential of using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to detect cell-type specific somatic mutations that accumulate in human brain cells. We applied a somatic mutation detection pipeline that contrasts genotypes derived from WGS data with genotypes derived from scRNA-seq data to 76 participants from the ROSMAP project, which is approved by an Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center as described in the Methods. All participants in this study signed an informed consent, Anatomical Gift Act, and a repository consent to share data and biospecimens. 

We identify 196 putative neuronal somatic mutations and show that the single base substitution (SBS) pattern of these putative somatic mutations is clock-like. We investigate how these somatic mutations are associated with age as well as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We identify the RBFOX1 and KCNIP4 genes to be enriched for more somatic mutations with increasing age. We also find the KCNQ5 and DCLK1 genes to have a higher odds ratio to accumulate somatic mutations in AD patients. We merged these two AD-specific genes with genes that have somatic mutations uniquely for AD patients and found enriched GO-term “vocalization behavior” and “interspecies interaction between organisms”. Intriguingly, we observe both age- and AD-specific somatic mutations presented in the K+ channels-associated genes.
